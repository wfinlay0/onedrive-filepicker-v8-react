React wrapper around the onedrive v8 file picker, lifted from [OneDrive/samples](https://github.com/OneDrive/samples/tree/master/samples/file-picking/typescript-react) and packaged up as a component library.

TODO: 
- use MsalProvider if it exists?
- add component (or prop) to use iframe instead of popup
- test build config
- export as a hook that returns click handlers to attach to whatever component you want
